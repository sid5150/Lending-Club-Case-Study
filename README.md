# Project Name
Lending Club Case Study
## General Information
Problem Statement A consumer finance company, which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers, has to make a decision on the loan applications based on the applicant’s profile and their probability to repay the loan. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Objectives The company aims to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default i.e. strong indicators / driving factors for default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio risk assessment, and for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. The objective of this case study is to use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Conclusions

The following features provide a set of strong indicators for the Lending club to perform a risk assessment on the loan applications.

Grades and higher interest rates are robust indicators to understand probability of defaulting. Lending club should have additional screening measures in place for grades such as G and high interest rates.
The probability for “charge off” is much higher in the following cases, therefore appropriate actions need to be taken to minimise the risk of loss. Applications with ‘Purpose’ of Small Business Applications with Home ownership of “Renting” Applications with Employee tenure of 10 years or more Applications with Lowest income group i.e. (3770.0, 42333.0] Applications from State CA etc Applications with Tenure of 60 months Public records and earlier bankruptcies
